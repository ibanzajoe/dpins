            <strong>What is homeowners insurance policy?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Homeowners insurance provides financial protection against disasters.  A standard policy not only insures the home and
            the building, but your other valuable possessions as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Homeowners insurance is a packaged policy meaning that it covers both damages to your property as well as covers your
            liabilities or legal responsibilities for any injuries or property damage you or members of your family caused to other people.  This
            includes damages caused by household pets.

            <strong>What is covered by a homeowners insurance?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Damage caused by most disasters is covered but there are exceptions.  The most significant exceptions are damages
            caused by floods, earthquakes, and poor maintenance.  For earthquakes and floods, you must buy separate policies to
            insure against them.  Maintenance-related problems are homeowners' responsibility.

            <strong>What is in a standard homeowners insurance policy? </strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            A standard homeowners insurance policy includes four essential types of coverage:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Coverage for the structure of your home
            </li>
            <li>
              Coverage for your personal belongings
            </li>
            <li>
              Liability protection
            </li>
            <li>
              Additional living expenses in the event you are temporarily unable to live in your home
            </li>

            <strong>1. The structure of your house</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This part of your policy pays to repair or rebuild your home if it is damaged or destroyed by fire, hurricane, hail,
            lightning, or other disaster listed in your policy.  It will not pay for damages caused by a flood, earthquake, or
            routine wear and tear.  When purchasing coverage for the structure of your home, it is important to buy enough to
            rebuild your home.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Most standard policies also cover structures that are detached from your home such as a garage, tool shed, or gazebo.
            Generally, these structures are covered for about 10% of the amount of insurance you have on the structure of your home.
            If you need more coverage, talk to your insurance agent about purchasing more insurance.

            <strong>2. Your personal belonging</strong>
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Your furniture, clothes, sports equipment, and other personal items are covered if they are stolen or
            destroyed by fire, hurricane, or other insured disaster.  most companies provide coverage for 50% to 70% of
            the amount of insurance you have on the structure of your home.  So if you have a $100,000 worth of insurance
            on the structure of your home, you would have between $50,000 to $70,000 worth of coverage for your belongings.
            The best way to determine if this is enough coverage is to conduct a home inventory.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Expensive items like jewelry, furs, and silverware are covered, but usually there are maximum limits if they are
            stolen.  Generally, you are covered for between $1,000 to $2,000 for all of your jewelry and furs.  To insure
            these items to their full value, purchase a special personal property endorsement or floater and insure the item
            for it's appraised value.  Coverage includes "accidental disappearance, " meaning coverage if you simply lose
            that item.  There are no deductible.

            <strong>3. Liability protection</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Liability covers you against lawsuits for bodily injury or property damage that you or family members cause to
            other people.  It also pays for damage caused by your pets.  So, if your son, daughter, or dog accidently
            ruins your neighbor's expensive rug, you are covered.  However, if they destroy your rug, you are not covered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your policy also provides no-fault medical coverage.  In the event a friend or neighbor is injured in your home,
            he or she can simply submit medical bills to your insurance company.  This way, expenses are paid without a
            liability claim being filed against you.  You can generally get $1,000 to $5,000 worth of this coverage.  It does not,
            however, pay the medical bills for yoru family or your pet.

            <strong>4. Additional living expenses</strong>
          </p>
      
          <p>
            This pays the additional costs of living away from home if you can't live there due to damages from fire,
            store, or other insured disaster.  It covers hotel bills, restaurant meals, and other living expenses incurred
            while your home is being rebuilt/repaired.  Coverage for additional living expenses differs from company to
            company.  Many policies provide coverage for about 20% of the insurance on your house.  You can increase this
            coverage, however, for an additional premium.  Some companies sell a policy that provides an unlimited amount of
            loss-of-use coverage, but for a limited amount of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you rent out part of your house, this coverage also reimburses you for the rent that you would have collected
            from your tenant if your home had not been destroyed.
