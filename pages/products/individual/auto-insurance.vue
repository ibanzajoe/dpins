            <strong>Why do we need car insurance?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In most states, it is illegal to drive without insurance.  If you own a car and wish to drive it, you most likely need an
            automobile insurance.  Having auto insurance is more than just protecting your vehicle, it is having a peace of mind from
            driver's worst nightmares like a bad accident, car-jacking, as well as possible bodily injuries and fatalities.

            <strong>What is an auto insurance</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            An auto insurance is a contract between you and your insurance company in which an agreement is established where you,
            the client, pays the insurance premium, and in exchange the insurance company agrees to reimburse you for any losses covered
            by the insurance policy.
