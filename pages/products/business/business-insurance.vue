            <strong>Why do you need business insurance?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            When running a business, you HAVE to consider your liabilities.  Even if you don't have a big, prosperous,
            business, liability insurance is essential and can be a crucial part of protecting your business and financial
            health.
          </p>
          <p>
            Liability insurance covers employees and customer injuries that may occur at your place of business.  Even in
            cases where someone you are not associated with causes someone else injury at your place of business,
            your business may still be held liable for damages.  Liability insurance can cover you from such claims of personal injury
            as well as any other claims involving any type of abuse and sexual harassment.
